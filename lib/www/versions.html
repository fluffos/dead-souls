 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Dead Souls 1.1pre</span><br><br>	This is the original. In 1997 or 1998 (there are conflicting <br>histories), <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Reese">Descartes</a> decided to release his development lib to the public <br>domain. It was a fine basis for any mud, but it was released without a <br>driver, and for various reasons including <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear%2C_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a> and difficulty setting it <br>up, people just didn't use it much.<br><br>	This distribution is largely a historical artifact at this point. <br>It can certainly serve as a basis for someone else's new lib distribution <br>project, or it can serve as a vital reference for those interested in the <br>minutiae of the development of the DS family. However it is not helpful <br>for "newbie" mud admins/owners. The learning curve required to<br>get this fine, but limited, lib is very steep.<br><br>You can download it here: <a
 href="http://lpmuds.net/files/deadsouls/ds1.1pre.tar.gz">http://lpmuds.net/files/deadsouls/ds1.1pre.tar.gz</a><br><br><br><a
 name="1.1"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Dead Souls 1.1</span><br><br>	In terms of lib code, this is almost identical to <br>Dead Souls 1.1pre. The main difference is that it includes the driver, <br>and has been fixed up to boot and work reasonably well upon installation. <br>It's also configured to connect to the yatmim intermud router.<br><br>	This version of Dead Souls (but not the driver) is also public <br>domain. Like Dead Souls 1.1pre it is mostly useful as a curiosity, <br>museum piece, or research specimen.<br><br>You can download it here: <a

 name="I"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Dead Souls I</span><br><br>	Pretty much the same as 1.1 but using FluffOS as a driver<br>to allow for greater compatibility with modern OS'es and PC's, and<br>it includes the Windows executable.<br><br>Available here: <a

 name="2.0r26"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Dead Souls 2.0r26</span><br><br>	The difference between Dead Souls 1.1 and 2.0r26 is dramatic. <br>Numerous samples exist, including a sample town. There is a <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/example.html">"code-free"<br>online creation system</a>. Many, many bugs are fixed, and useful new systems <br>implemented, such as a menu based administration tool.<br><br>	2.0r26 also contains the documentation that Descartes had pulled <br>from 1.1pre. With his permission, I added his old Nightmare docs, which <br>are something like 99.99% applicable to Dead Souls. In addition to those <br>docs, 2.0r26 contains DS-specific documentation.<br><br>	Finally, 2.0r26 contains not only driver source for UNIX <br>installs, it also  contains a pre-compiled driver executable for Windows, <br>so that in a single distribution, you have everything you need to run <br>Dead Souls on either UNIX or Microsoft Windows.<br><br>	2.0r26 is not public domain software. Unlike the 1.x versions, <br>2.0r26 is distributed under the <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpl">GPL</a>. This is actually not very meaningful <br>for software that is designed to run from interpreted plaintext files. <br>It was a futile attempt to comply with the licensing of other software <br>that it used to be bundled with. It's no longer bundled with GPL <br>stuff, so again, there's not much point in it being GPL.<br><br>	The fact that 2.0r26 is still distributed under GPL is largely <br>due to 1) laziness on my part 2) the requirement of SourceForge to <br>have only <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">OSS</a> software hosted on their site 3) I think that's it. <br>Laziness and convenience.<br><br></big><big>You can download it here: <a
 href="http://lpmuds.net/files/deadsouls/dead_souls_2.0r26b.zip">http://lpmuds.net/files/deadsouls/dead_souls_2.0r26b.zip</a></big><br><big><br><br><a
 name="2.10.x"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Dead Souls 2.10.x</span><br><br>	2.10.x represents a "finished, stable product". <br>While in theory you could easily run a successful mud with 2.0r26, if <br>you run into a bug or a problem, the answer in almost every case is <br>"upgrade to 2.10.x", so I generally encourage people to avoid 2.0r26 <br>and download 2.10.x instead. It also has <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/RELEASE_NOTES">major new improvements</a><br>both in features and security.<br><br>	The licensing for 2.10.x is not GPL and not PD. It's a sort of<br><a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/code/ds2.1.1/LICENSE">muddled proprietary  license</a> which basically says "you can use this as <br>a mud, modify it, whatever, have fun, but I retain copyright". It's vague <br>because I simply am sick of thinking about licensing. It's not GPL <br>because I'm even sicker of people telling me what I can or can't do <br>with my GPL'ed software.<br><br>	My "I can't be bothered to think about licensing" attitude <br>tends to freak out some people for whom licensing is Really Really <br>Important. So you may see flames back and forth between me and such <br>people on various mud discussion forums. I think that's pretty <br>normal. If you hear anyone referring to Dead Souls and licensing<br>issues, it's almost certainly a reference to the controversy and <br>friction caused by my adversarial relationship with folks I affectionately <br>refer to as the License Taliban.<br></big><big><br></big><big>You can download it here: <a

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Dead Souls II</span><br><br>	This is a version of Dead Souls derived from 2.x, but which <br>has had documentation removed. It also has had various files that I did <br>not write removed. The result is a lib which is about 98 to 99% code-identical <br>to 2.x, but is actually public domain.<br><br>	The reasons for releasing years' worth of work into the public<br>domain are explained in the <a

 name="2.Xa"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Dead Souls 2.XaX</span><br><br> "Alpha versions" are rough, pre-release packages that are like the official<br>release, except they are more cutting edge. That makes them both fun to try <br>out (which is why I make them available) but also not really stable to use<br>for your production mud, because often with new features come new bugs.<br><br>One of the big reasons I'm not doing frequent public releases, with <br>patches, is that a great many of the things I'm doing represent compatibility <br>breakers with stable releases. If I did frequent "official" releases and upgrades, <br>people would be running into compat problems continually.<br><br>Instead, I'm holding off until I'm more confident that the big compat busters <br>are taken care of, so that subsequent releases and upgrades are less painful. <br>The idea is to have big compat pain just the once.<br><br>So, that's the idea of making sneak-peek alphas available, but not officially <br>supported releases.<br><br>Having said that, the alpha releases are as runtime stable and more <br>feature-rich  than any released lpmud lib you'll find out there, so when I say <br>they are "unstable", it is relative to what I expect DS official releases <br>to be, and also in part refers to the fact that alphas are subject to frequent<br>updates and changes.<br><br>For information on the big differences between recent alphas and the stable <br>release, read this: <a
