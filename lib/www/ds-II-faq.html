 name="whatis"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What is Dead Souls II?</span><br><br>Dead Souls IIr10 is a public domain version of Dead Souls. It contains<br>much of what was released as "Dead Souls 2.10", meaning it<br>is dramatically more featured and complete than the previous<br>major public domain version, which is Dead Souls 1.1.<br><br>It is critical to note that the driver source and<br>windows executables are most emphatically NOT public domain. <br>The contents of fluffos*/ and win32/ are copyrighted<br>material, and it does not belong to me, so I cannot release<br>the rights to that. <br><br>Only the stuff in lib/ in the Dead Souls II distribution<br>package is public domain.<br></big><big><br><br></big><big><a
 name="differences"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How does it differ from Dead Souls 2?</span><br><br></big><big>The main differences are:<br>- Roman numerals are used in the name, to distinguish the versions.<br>- DS II does not contain documentation files in /doc.<br>- All of the library files (NOT the driver!) are public domain.<br>- Some files not written by me have been removed or disabled, like stargate stuff.<br><br></big><big><br><a
 name="why"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why are you releasing Dead Souls II into the public domain?</span><br><br>I started the DS resurrection project for the fun of it. I'm not under the<br>delusion that this will make me money. I'm in it because I like lib coding,<br>and it was really fun to do.<br><br>DS 1.1 being in the public domain dramatically facilitated the project,<br>and it has always been my intention to make DS available to the public,<br>so they can enjoy it as much as I have.<br><br>Along the way I've run into all sorts of nasty people who appear to<br>take pleasure in nitpicking details about licensing and whatnot. I<br>really couldn't care less about such stuff. I just like to code. The<br>rest is just a game of "gotcha" that I can't be bothered to participate in.<br><br>So, in releasing my code into the public domain, I achieve the following:<br><br>1) I give back to the community a little piece of it in shape better than I found it.<br>2) I increase the likelihood that someone else will pick it up, make it their own, and also give back.<br>3) I get to not think about licensing, which is just a waste of my time.<br><br><br></big><big><a
 name="whynot"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why don't you release Dead Souls 2.x into PD?</span><br><br>As long as 2.x has stuff that doesn't belong to me, it can't<br>be PD. Since there are docs for DS that will never be mine, <br>there will probably always be separate "proprietary" and<br>"public domain" versions.<br><br></big><big><br><a
 name="docs"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why did you remove the documentation?</span><br><br>Two main reasons. First, a lot of it isn't mine, so there's that.<br><br>Second, I feel differently about the release of prose. It's one thing<br>to free code...its use is unambiguous and somehow it just makes sense.<br><br>But to me, my prose represents more of an expression of my creativity<br>than code. It just feels different to me.<br><br>This doesn't mean you can't use it. You're welcome to use the<br>documentation from the non-PD version of Dead Souls. I'm just<br>not releasing it into the public domain.<br><br><br><a
 name="crippleware"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why would anyone want to run this crippleware?</span><br><br>Well, see, it's not crippleware. Sure, there are a few files I<br>removed because they're not mine, but in terms of code, DS IIr10 and<br>DS 2.10 are something like 99.99% the same.<br><br><br><a
 name="notpd"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Hey this file doesn't look like it's PD!</span><br><br>I've gone through the lib with a fine-toothed comb. Even if it<br>seems like someone is explicitly retaining rights in a file,<br>you can safely presume that this file was already PD by the time<br>I got it.<br><br>If you're certain, though, that I've missed something, please<br>let me know, and I'll address it right away.<br><br><br><a
 name="mystuff"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I would have let you release my stuff into PD. Why didn't you ask?</span><br><br>The authors of the files I excluded might be surprised that<br>they weren't asked about including their material in DS II. With<br>the exception of the authors of a few files that would have been a<br>hassle to rewrite from scratch, I decided not to contact authors. I<br>simply didn't include other people's stuff.<br><br>The reason isn't that your stuff isn't "good enough".<br><br>It's that I wanted everyone to see that I'm putting my<br>money where my mouth is. Before asking anyone to give up<br>their IP for free, I wanted to demonstrate that I'm not<br>asking you to do anything I wouldn't do myself.<br><br><br><a
 name="where"></a><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Ok, where do I get it?</span><br><br>Download the new public domain version of Dead Souls here:<br><br><a

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What's the
catch?</span><br>
<br>
You can expect to find a few bugs here and there in Dead Souls II<br>
that are fixed in more recent versions of the 2.x family. This<br>
is because DS II is unsupporeted and therefore static. <br>
<br>
If you run into trouble running DS II, you can certainly <br>
ask for help, but if the problem is resolved in later versions of DS 2,<br>
I'm not going to develop a fix for DS II. If you're using the<br>
public domain version, I assume it's because you're a DIY kind<br>
of person. So...DIY.<br>
<br>
The only advantage to using DS II over DS 2 is that you know<br>
you can use the lib in nonstandard ways, like fork lib development,<br>
sell it to the Chinese, whatever, and I simply cannot prevent<br>
you from it.<br>
<br>
If all you're doing is running a mud, though, DS II really<br>
doesn't do anything for you. I'd suggest installing one<br>
of the <a href="http://dead-souls.net/code/dead_souls.zip">current,
proprietary versions of DS 2</a>.<br>
<br>
But hey, at least now you have a choice one way or another,<br>
and choice is good.<br>
<br>
<br>
The end.<br>
