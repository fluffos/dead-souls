 style="font-weight: bold;">The lpmuds.net Site<br><br></big></big>	This is starting to become a bit of a frequently<br>asked question, but the proper answer is long, and the<br>short answer makes it seem like something hostile is<br>going on. This page is intended to clarify the origin<br>and purpose of the lpmuds.net site.<br><br>	Some months ago I got fed up with the way the<br>lpuni.org site looked. Its purpose was unclear, its<br>navigation and priorities, in my opinion, very confusing.<br>After a long time of arguing and cajoling with Tacitus,<br>I decided that I'd take the DIY approach and<br>set up a simple site, with a simple purpose: promoting LP.<br>That is, both LPmuds and the LPC language. Just a resource<br>site...no executive boards, no free hosting, no<br>plenipotentiary council meetings. Just a site, with<br>an easy to read format, and helpful LP type stuff.<br><br>	After this, Tacitus presumably understood what I'd<br>been talking about, and changed lpuni.org a little to<br>help the newcomer get a better handle on what that site is.<br><br>	Since then, I haven't done much with the lpmuds.net<br>site, because I assumed Tacitus would make that site<br>superfluous.<br><br>	Today I'm not so sure. It's been months, and not<br>a single of the "FAQ"'s on the lpuni.org front page got<br>a link. Dead Souls people have complained to me about<br>lpuni and even left that organization due to political<br>disputes. The atmosphere has even made people stop participating<br>on the forums there, which was pretty much the whole point<br>of me asking Dead Soulers to go there.<br><br><a
 name="hope"></a>	I truly, sincerely hope that lpuni gets itself<br>together and squared away. I believe in its goals, and<br>have always been an avid public supporter. I don't think I<br>need to prove my <span
 style="font-style: italic;">bona fides</span> on that. I've shown that I'm<br>more than willing to put my money where my mouth is...I have<br>actually already done so.<br><br>	However, given what's been going on, and the fact that<br>lpuni has been down more than it's been up lately, I've<br>decided that it's time to revive the old lpmuds.net site<br>and get it to do the things I've been wishing lpuni would do.<br><br>	Whether it's fixing up a dead lib, or setting up<br>my own router, or setting up hosting for lpu, folks should<br>know by now I'm not a "stand around and hope someone does<br>something" kind of guy. I'm all about DIY, and that's what<br>this move is about.  <br><br><a
 name="competition"></a>	Now, some folks out there are of the opinion that<br>I'm trying to "compete" with lpuni, and "beat" Tacitus in<br>some way. I've found myself trying to explain that it is not<br>so, but I don't think I'll convince all. Let me at least<br>explain here my thoughts on that...and let the chips fall<br>where they may.<br><br>	It is true that I'm planning on spending less time<br>at the lpuni.org site, and now that Tacitus is not using<br>Wolfpaw, will have less involvement in general. However,<br>curtailing my involvement isn't about being huffy. It's not<br>about my personal feelings regarding Tacitus. It really<br>just makes sense for me to step away a little, for the following<br>reasons:<br><br><a
 name="1"></a>1) I want a forum that all DS'ers feel comfortable in. Since<br>lpuni doesn't do that, I will be spending more time on lpmuds.net.<br><br><a
 name="2"></a>2) I have too many conflicts with lpuni. Whether it's my opinion<br>on donations (accepting them the way lpuni does makes me uncomfortable),<br>or my attitude toward the way the website used to look, or my<br>concern about hosting on Kyndig, or any of a variety of other<br>issues, my viewpoint gets construed as hostile and anti-lpu,<br>rather than anti-whatever-it-is-I'm-disagreeing-with. I think<br>this causes unnecessary conflict in the community. Tacitus is<br>the lpuni boss, I'm ok with him being the absolute authority<br>there, and I'm walking away from there so that nobody thinks I'm<br>trying to oppose what lpuni is trying to do.<br><br><a
 name="3"></a>3) lpmuds.net <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">cannot</span> compete with lpuni.org, because lpuni's<br>stated strategies involve things I have absolutly no interest<br>whatsoever in. You're not going to get departments heads,<br>ministries of education, LPC certification authorities, or<br>any of that from lpmuds.net. This is just a resource site, with<br>forums, downloads, and docs. That's it. What's to compete?<br><br><br><a
 name="summary"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Summary:</span><br><br>* I will be spending less time on lpuniversity stuff.<br><br>* I will, however, continue to host lpuni meetings as long as lpu wants.<br><br>* The lpmuds.net site is going up, and staying up. It is both the<br>official support site for Dead Souls 2 and a place for LP mud fans<br>of all stripes to congregate with a minimum of political strife.<br><br>* The lpmuds.net site is not intended to compete with lpuni.org in<br>a hostile way. The way topmudsites.com and mudconnector.com are<br>both complementary and competitive, so I envision the relationship<br>between lpmuds.net and lpuni.org.<br><br>* LPU people are welcome at lpmuds, and there is already a topic<br>dedicated to them there.<br><br>* Mommy and Daddy still love you. We just have different houses now.<br><br><br>	 	<br><a
