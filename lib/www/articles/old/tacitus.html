 class="sb_messagebody"><br>Hey folks,<br><br>I'm getting the drift that some people feel there is some<br>sort of political big deal going on between Tacitus and me.<br><br>I just wanted to take this opportunity to clarify things<br>a bit.<br><br>Yes, I *do* have a problem with Tacitus-the-person, who has<br>personally offended me, put people at risk, and been an<br>all around source of unpleasantness for me lately.<br><br>However, I am not interested in, nor do I have the time for,<br>some kind of Kyndig/Samson style feud. I appreciate all the<br>supportive emails, and the kind words both on- and off- the<br>record. But in the end, all I want to do is make Dead Souls<br>the best LPC lib ever, and getting into a juvenile pissing match<br>is exactly the sort of thing that makes that difficult.<br><br>So, be aware of the fact that I want people to contribute to his<br>site, and I want LPU to be successful, because that is an<br>overall plus for Dead Souls. Please keep up the community<br>participation.<br><br>Whatever I've been doing lately to express my displeasure<br>with Tacitus has nothing to do with you guys, and I am not<br>interested in ganging up on anyone. Please just let me<br>be angry with Tacitus, and carry on with your business.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>-Crat<br><br><br><span
