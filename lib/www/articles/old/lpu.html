 style="font-weight: bold;">Dead Souls and LPUniversity Libs</big></big><br><br>	There is some question about the<br>relationship between the Dead Souls mudlib and<br>the LPUniversity mudlib. Hopefully the description<br>below will unmuddy those waters.<br><br>	Think of LPUniversity as a lib designed<br>from the ground up with LPC education in mind. It<br>is intended to be a lib coder's lib: crafted to<br>precise specifications and tight tolerances.<br><br>	You'll have to ask him, but it's my <br>impression that Tacitus intends the LPUniversity<br>lib to be a sort of gold standard of how<br>LP libs should be.<br><br>	As such, it's going to take a long time<br>to get the LPUniversity lib into the kind of<br>shape it needs to be in order to have a high<br>adoption rate. You can think of it as a Rolls<br>Royce under construction, still up on the lift.<br><br>	Dead Souls is ready for prime-time. Though<br>it lacks some fun stuff that will be added in<br>the future, everything you need is there for<br>making almost whatever you want, right away. It's<br>not perfect, but it works. If LPUniversity is<br>a Rolls on the build lift, Dead Souls is the<br>Honda Civic in your driveway. Nothing to scream<br>about, really, but it works great and takes you<br>where you need to go.<br><br>	The two libs complement each other. The<br>point of Dead Souls has always been to get more<br>people using LPC. The point of the LPUniversity<br>umbrella project (which includes the LPUlib) has<br>been to get more people using LPC. <br>	<br>	By affiliating with Dead Souls, LPU gains<br>a larger potential base of interested people. <br>Dead Souls can be downloaded and run now, and put<br>into production as quickly as you can build your<br>world for it. This active user base strengthens<br>the LPUniversity project by participating in the<br>LPC community.<br><br>	By affiliating with the LPU project, Dead<br>Souls gains a resource for LPC discussion that<br>has been sorely needed. Discussion forums and healthy<br>competition between libs is the sort of thing that<br>breeds interest in Dead Souls, breeding interest in<br>LPC at large.<br><br>	Everyone wins.<br><br>	So that's pretty much it. The LPU lib is<br>the car that's going to r0x0r but isn't ready to<br>to roll yet. Dead Souls is the car that may not <br>look as pretty, but has it where it counts. It<br>actually turns over and gets you around.<br><br>	 	<br><a
