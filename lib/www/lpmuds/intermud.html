      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of 27 March 2006, the intermud.org i3
router stopped functioning. There had been some talk on the dead_souls
channel of how unreliable the i3 router was, and how we should make our
own, etc, yakety schmakety.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; March 27th was the last straw. For Dead Souls
developers, the dead_souls intermud channel was a vital resource for
development discussion and support. I
decided it was time to implement a router that the Dead Souls muds
could count on.<br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><a name="zomg"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ZOMG! The *gjs router is down now! It's
your fault!</span><br>
      <br>
I honestly have no idea at all what happened to the gjs router. During
June and July of 2006, it seemed to be up about as often as it was
down...it was unreliable in the extreme. I'd never seen it that bad
before.<br>
      <br>
Then, in August 2006, while discussing this unreliability:<br>
      <br>
[2006.08.01-13.45] Salius@Elanathia &lt;imud_gossip&gt; so what keeps
happening, why does it crash<br>
[2006.08.01-14.03] Cratylus &lt;intergossip&gt; who runs it? are they
ever on?<br>
[2006.08.01-14.05] Zakk@Lima Bean &lt;imud_gossip&gt; 'run' hahaha etc<br>
      <br>
And that's the last transmission I'm aware of, as of today, 21 September 
2008. As if it weren't bad enough that it looks like it's down for the
count, it also appears Zakk had the last word.<br>
      <br>
Please note. If I'd known gjs would die, I would not have made the
intergossip channel a default for Dead Souls muds. I had no intent to
be The New Intermud For Everyone, and I didn't know it would happen, so
please don't imagine I'm trying to reform anyone. I'm just running my
own router, to which you're invited if you follow the rules.<br>

Instructions for Dead Souls 2 MUDs:<br>
To switch back and forth between the routers, use the switchrouter
command. For syntax and instructions,<br>
type: help switchrouter<br>
      <br>
Other muds will need to follow their intermud subsystem documentation.
Note
that there may be multiple files and multiple parts of those files that

 style="font-weight: bold;">I3 doesn't work</span><br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting the router name wrong is the number one
cause of errors. Also, once you get it wrong, your own client cache
might keep the old one, even if you change your intermud client code.
Make sure you purge the i3 data cache before you try again.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another major cause is that the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">router</span> name is
right, but you've chosen a <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">mud</span> name someone
else already is using. If your mud's name is "DeadSoulsNew" or "Your
Mud's Name" or "ds-test" or "TestMud" or somesuch, the router won't let
you on because
some other newbie got there before you and now the router has
associated their ip with that that name. Pick something unique and try
again.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next most likely reason you can't connect is
that your mud handles intermud passwords incorrectly and your ip
address changed. The way intermud passwords work is this: <br>
      <br>
1) You connect to the intermud router <br>
2) It generates a random number and gives it to you. That's your
password. <br>
3) If you disconnect, then come back with a different ip address, your
mud sends that password to the router which then says "ok I recognize
that password as being for your mud, I'll let you on". <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your mud's I3 client doesn't save your password
and your ip address changes (which can happen very frequently if your
mud is on a DSL or cable modem) then the router will assume you are not
who you say you are, and deny the connection. To see if this is what's
happening, change your mud name to something new (and unique) and try
again.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cases, some muds misbehave in a way that is
either unacceptable to the router, violates the router rules, or
interferes with the normal operation of the router. If your mud does
not have a useful admin contact email address that it sends to the
router on connection, then nobody can be contacted to help correct this
situation. This means your mud may have been banished or firewalled out
without you knowing about it. If the router in question is yatmim or
i4, send me an email. My name is Cratylus, and I have an email account
with a comcast dot net domain address. <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under some circumstances, such as an unusually
lossy/unstable network connection, and most specifically a wireless
connection, the router may have a hard time maintaining your mud
online, and once dropped, you may not be able to get back on. At the
risk of being old-fashioned, I suggest that you put your mud on a
stable, land-line internet connection.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it may be that the router you've chosen is
dead or temporarily offline. Try one of the routers listed above, or
ask on the <a href="http://lpmuds.net/forum/index.php?board=4.0">intermud
board</a> of the lpmuds.net discussion forum to see if someone has set
up a different router for you to use.<br>

      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim@TimMUD wrote a swell LPC based I3 router that is
basically a bunch of .h files you put into a TMI-2 mud. You tinker with
the settings a bit, and your TMI-2 mud becomes an intermud router.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I installed it in a Dead Souls mud, and it's been
updated to handle a multiple-hub network, as well as translating IMC2
data.<br>

      <br>
With Tim's blessing I've included his I3 router in the Dead Souls
distribution, after removing/replacing some non-Tim code. This means
that any Dead Souls mud can serve as a hub, should it wish to
establish its own intermud network. Eventually these individual hubs
may be part of a failover network, but there are no firm plans
for this in place.<br>

Read the code in /secure/daemon/i3router and /secure/daemon/imc2server.
Understand it. Then modify it
to suit you. I won't be posting step-by-step instructions on how to do
this, because I believe this is one of those things that you really
need to figure out on your own. If you can't figure it out by reading
the code, I argue you have no business running the router.<br>

It's puzzling how often I get this. Even though the <a href="#rules">router
rules</a> are prominently shown, and I have shown willingness to
confront offenders, some people still insist on trying to make racist
comments on the protected channels, or try to harsh out newbies.<br>
      <br>
I don't know which part of "<span style="font-style: italic;">this is
not the old router</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic;">this
router
has enforced rules</span>" is hard to understand. There is, perhaps, a
sense of
entitlement to any channel named "intergossip" regardless of the router.<br>
      <br>
I really don't ask for much. Just follow the rules on the few protected
channels, and adhere to their declared topics. You're here as a guest,
by choice. If you don't like it, you are free to make your own channel
for trash talk, and of course, you are free to disconnect&nbsp; at any
time.<br>

      <br>
The yatmim router started off as an ad-hoc sort of thing. gjs was down
a lot, and newbies got harshed out a lot, and it seemed reasonable to
slap something together for DS muds to get around those obstacles. From
its start, roughly April 2006, to about September 2006, it was really
only Dead Souls muds that ever connected to it. I spent a long time
tweaking things, and by September the router, I thought, was in dead
solid shape. When gjs went down for the count, I figured yatmim was
ready for prime time.<br>
      <br>
I was mistaken.<br>
      <br>
It turns out that there are many ways to interpret the I3 specs. It
also turns out that in spots, the specs are oddly silent, and those
silences can also be interpreted in many ways. Different libs and
codebases have implemented their I3 subsystems and tuned it for their
specific needs, with gjs's specific habits in mind. Tim's
interpretation of the I3 router specs was a solid one, and done in good
faith. But it was different enough from the way gjs conducted business
that some muds have had a tough time adjusting.<br>
      <br>
An example of this is the recent tuning I did. Some muds send a startup
request packet indicating they are using protocol 2, but the packet
itself is formatted for protocol 3. Tim's router justifiably rejected
such errored data. gjs, apparently, forgave it. I have therefore
changed yatmim to implement that forgiveness, so that old muds with
this legacy header can join. Now imagine a bunch of other minor
variances like this. It's not the sort of stuff you can test for on a
lab system and nail each one...it's real world conflicts that can only
be found and corrected while running in production.<br>
      <br>
So, because some of this stuff can only be diagnosed live, and because
fixing it requires bringing down the public server, some people have
gotten the idea that "yatmim sucks". This, I think, is not true, and
unfair. yatmim is undergoing some turbulence while I catch and squash
these unexpected problems. However, the code itself is rapidly
approaching the kind of stability that I can be proud of, and I'm happy
to be able to provide that to the community. I3 node uptime regularly
reaches sixteen weeks or more.<br>
      <br>
The short answer as to why the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">i3</span> router sucks
is "It doesn't any more."<br>
      <br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">IMC2</span>
server is still in its very early infancy, though, and there is still
much work to do. If the IMC2 connection to the LPMuds.net network is
not working like you think it should, <a
 href="http://lpmuds.net/forum/index.php?board=4.0">please let me know
what's going on</a> so I can try to address it.<br>

<a name="rules"></a>Network Rules<br>
</div>
<br>
<a name="1"></a>1) The point of this network being up is not free
speech.<br>
<br>
<a name="2"></a>2) This network is up for the following purposes:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To provide technical help for muds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To provide a friendly space for chat between muds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To test and improve mud communication systems,
such as intermud mail.<br>
<br>
<a name="3"></a>3) The network is not up for testing security of an
intrermud network. Attempting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to exploit the hubs is not ok, and not "cool". If you
find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a security weakness please email me so I can handle it
discreetly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; You will get full credit for the discovery when the patch
comes out.<br>
<br>
<a name="4"></a>4) The following are not tolerated on protected
channels: hate speech, social engineering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; hacks, being Robert Mugabe, unwarranted hostility to newbies, spamming,
commercial advertising. All of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these will be judged by my subjective opinion of what
constitutes a violation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Types of violations can be added to this list without
warning by me.<br>
<br>
<a name="5"></a>5) Otherwise legitimate use of a non-protected channel
or hub subsystem which <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; interferes with normal function of the network is not
tolerated.<br>
<br>
<a name="6"></a>6) You may create intermud channels for your mud. These
channels can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; have any content you want that is permissible by all
applicable laws. I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; don't want to control the intermud with an iron hand. I
just want those protected<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; channels listed above to be a safe place for newbies to
congregate, socialize,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and/or get work done.<br>
<br>
<a name="7"></a>7) If you don't like these rules, set up your own
network. <br>
<br>
<a name="8"></a>8) I will not help or support you in any way in setting
up a hub, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; in creating a channel for your mud. These undocumented
procedures require<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; expertise to accomplish that you have to earn on your own
by reading<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the code on your mud and the relevant specs.<br>
<br>
<a name="9"></a>9) You can file complaints to me by email, or by
explaining the problem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; on the appropriate area on lpmuds.net. I prefer to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; deal with complaints from the admin of the mud in
question, since the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; responsibility for maintaining that intermud connection is
theirs. Please<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; note that I am not the arbiter of inter-mud disputes. If
someone is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; being mean to you through tells or on unprotected
channels, you need to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; find some way of dealing with it yourself. Also, if
someone logs onto your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; mud and starts abusing channels you haven't secured, this
is not something<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm in a position to control. Logging onto my mud and
complaining that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; people on your mud are abusing channels is useless (yes,
this really has happened).<br>
<br>
<a name="10"></a>10) I'm only human and sometimes I'll err in judgment.
If you think I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made an error, please email me. Perhaps I banned
your mud out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem on your mud
has been fixed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to be open minded about this stuff, if you try
to be reasonable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="clarifications"></a>Clarifications and suggestions:<br>
<br>
<a name="customs"></a>- A channel may have customs more restrictive
than the rules here show.<br>
For example, because ds and dchat are turned on by default on<br>
Dead Souls muds, and I don't want newbies immediately scared away<br>
and/or offended, I ask that foul language be avoided when<br>
possible. On the other hand, a channel like intergossip has<br>
the tradition of being quite raunchy and not<br>
geared toward technical talk, so you might find a hostile reaction<br>
when asking for code help there. Use your common sense and try to<br>
follow the customs of a channel. Showing up and expecting a<br>
channel to accept your topic and discussion habits<br>
no matter what is not really a good idea.<br>
<br>
<a name="channelcustoms"></a>- On a related note, please remember that
this is not gjs, and<br>
the customs of gjs channels may not be acceptable here, even<br>
if the channel names are the same.<br>
<br>
<a name="emails"></a>- An email address in your startup packet is not
explicitly demanded,<br>
as you can see. However, it's *strongly* urged that you put a valid<br>
email address in there. This is because if someone on your mud is<br>
getting out of hand, or your connection is causing technical problems,<br>
I need a way to talk to someone in charge of things on your mud.<br>
<br>
<a name="warnings"></a>- When someone on a mud is violating rules, they
usually get a<br>
number of warnings, and if they are not admins, their admins are<br>
also notified as possible. Whether warnings are issued is obviously<br>
dependent on the type of behavior. Sufficiently disruptive behavior<br>
(at my discretion) can subject a mud to immediate action without<br>
warning. But this is extremely rare. Warnings are provided<br>
when reasonable. If the behavior doesn't stop, then that mud may be<br>
banned from the channel where it's causing problems. If the mud<br>
then causes problems on other channels, it may be banned from<br>
the router entirely. This is a drastic and very unusual situation.<br>
<br>
<a name="problems"></a>- Sometimes a mud causes technical problems and
I can't get<br>
a hold of an admin. In the past, for example, some muds have<br>
accidentally messed up their intermud daemon, and wound up<br>
spamming the router with dozens of connection requests<br>
per second. Because they are not fully connected, they can't be<br>
contacted through channels, and because their admins weren't<br>
checking their email, I couldn't get them to stop. In a case<br>
like this, the mud generally will get firewalled out, so that<br>
the router stops receiving any data at all from that mud. If<br>
your mud just won't connect to the router no matter what,<br>
something like this may have happened. Email me and we'll<br>
straighten it out.<br>
